# Basics.css

Basics.css is a simple css library made for css wizards.

This is created completely using SCSS. The source code can be viewed in the `src` folder. The `js` directory should be ignored it's just used to render the HTML. The `style` folder is where all the scss code is at.

# Usage

You can use Basics.css in any of your projects for free. To use it, just download the `main.css` file from the `dist` folder. The `main.css` file is not minified for easier readability. You can minimise it for production use.
